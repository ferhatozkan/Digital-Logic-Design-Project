# Digital-Logic-Design-Project
University of Marmara, CSE3015 2018 Fall Project

<h1><b>
  Basic CPU design with Logisim and Verilog
</b></h1>

<h1><b> This project contains: </b></h1>
  <li> Part 1 contains Assembler written in Python </li>
  <li> Part 2 contains Logisim design of CPU and its components </li>
  <li> Part 3 contains Verilog code of our CPU </li>
  <li> Also detailed project report can be found in repository </li>
  
<h1><b> Detailed information: </b></h1>
<ul>
<li>Data Memory.txt contains the initial values of the memory.</li>
<li>Input.txt contains instructions to be executed.</li>
<li>Instruction Memory.txt contains instructions in assembly format.</li>
<li>Assembler.java is a assembler taking instructions from Input.txt and converting them into 5 byte long binary format instructions. (Creating Instruction Memory.txt)</li>
<li>Instruction Memory.txt contains instruction in binary format.</li>
<li>Project.circ file is a logic design imlementation of our CPU. The file can be executed in "Logisim" design tool.</li>
<li>Detailed explanation of the project is available in the ProjectReport.docx file.</li>  
</ul>
